Recursion  = Recursion is a function that refers to itself from inside the function. 
Basically, a function that refers to itself.
Recursive functions have two paths -> The recursive case (recalls the function) and the base case (stops the function call)


Uses = Searching , Sorting and transversing a tree

Con = Risk of Stack Overflow (Cos the computer need to keep lots of memory to remember everything)
Base case = Needed in a recursive function to prevent stack overflow.

Rules for writing recursive functions
1. Identify the base case
2. Identify the recursive case
3. Get closer and closer and return when needed.
You usually have two returns, one for the base case and another for 
the recursive case.
